# `Arm/` ‚Äì ESP32 Robotic Arm Controller

This folder contains the firmware and structural files for the robotic arm used in the **BitArm project** ‚Äî a BLE-controlled, 3D-printed manipulator with three degrees of freedom and a claw. The arm is actuated by **three MG90S servos** (base, shoulder, elbow) and **one SG90 servo** (claw), all controlled by an **ESP32-DevKitC-32**.

To improve stability and reduce mechanical stress on the base motor, the structure includes a **ball bearing at the rotation axis**, allowing for smoother and more reliable movement.

Commands are sent via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** from a Raspberry Pi Pico W touchscreen interface. Each command corresponds to a predefined position or claw movement, and transitions are executed smoothly to reduce mechanical stress and improve precision.

The ESP32 is mounted on a **custom shield**, which distributes power and simplifies wiring. This folder includes the control firmware (`arm_controller.c`) and mechanical design files (in the `Structure/` subfolder).

## Power Supply

- The robotic arm requires a **5V power source** capable of delivering at least **2.5A** to operate safely and reliably.
- A **20000mAh / 22.5W USB power bank** is recommended for portability and stable current delivery. But an equivalent Lithium battery also can be used.
- **Do not power the ESP32 and servos via a computer USB port**, as it cannot supply sufficient current for all motors.
- The **custom ESP32 shield** ensures clean power distribution to all components, preventing voltage drops and unexpected resets during motion.

## üì° Pin Mapping (ESP32 ‚Üí Servos)

| Function      | GPIO (ESP32) | Description                        |

- **PWM Frequency:** 50 Hz  
- **PWM Resolution:** 16 bits

## BLE Command Protocol

The robotic arm receives commands via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** ‚Äî a low-power wireless communication protocol commonly used in embedded and IoT devices.

Each command is sent as a single character and interpreted by the ESP32 as follows:

| Command | Action                        |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| `'0'`‚Äì`'7'` | Move to one of eight preset positions |
| `'8'`       | Open the claw (to 60¬∞)               |
| `'9'`       | Close the claw (to 120¬∞)             |

Servo transitions are performed smoothly to reduce mechanical stress and improve motion precision.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Arm/` folder in **PlatformIO**, using the **ESP32 DevKitC** environment.
2. Upload `arm_controller.c` to your ESP32 board.
3. Connect the ESP32 to a **5V power source** (e.g., power bank) via the custom shield.
4. On the Raspberry Pi Pico W, start the BLE interface and press the **‚ÄúA‚Äù button** on the touchscreen.
5. Once connected, use the touch interface to send commands (`'0'`‚Äì`'9'`) to the arm.
6. The ESP32 receives the BLE command and moves the servos smoothly to the target position or claw state.

## Final Considerations

This robotic arm structure was inspired by the open-source design shared at [Thingiverse ‚Äì Robotic Arm (MG90S based)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1684471). While the **claw mechanism** was directly adapted from that model ‚Äî with minor adjustments for fit and integration ‚Äî the rest of the structure was designed in  Tinkercad, using the former [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1684471) project as a reference to design pieces that suit the specific goals and constraints of this project.

One of the key structural improvements made in this design was the addition of a **608Zz ball bearing at the base**. This enhancement significantly reduces the mechanical load on the base servo motor, providing:

- **Smoother rotational motion**
- **Greater stability**
- **Reduced wear on the servo gear system**

The result is a more robust and precise base movement, especially useful in setups where the arm must rotate frequently or support added mass.
