# `Arm/` ‚Äì ESP32 Robotic Arm Controller

This folder contains the firmware and structural files for the robotic arm used in the **BitArm project** ‚Äî a BLE-controlled, 3D-printed manipulator with three degrees of freedom and a claw. The arm is actuated by **three MG90S servos** (base, shoulder, elbow) and **one SG90 servo** (claw), all controlled by an **ESP32-DevKitC-32**.

To improve stability and reduce mechanical stress on the base motor, the structure includes a **ball bearing at the rotation axis**, allowing for smoother and more reliable movement.

Commands are sent via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** from a Raspberry Pi Pico W touchscreen interface. Each command corresponds to a predefined position or claw movement, and transitions are executed smoothly to reduce mechanical stress and improve precision.

The ESP32 is mounted on a **custom shield**, which distributes power and simplifies wiring. This folder includes the control firmware (`arm_controller.c`) and mechanical design files (in the `Structure/` subfolder).

## Power Supply

- The robotic arm requires a **5V power source** capable of delivering at least **2.5A** to operate safely and reliably.
- A **20000mAh / 22.5W USB power bank** is recommended for portability and stable current delivery. But an equivalent Lithium battery also can be used.
- **Do not power the ESP32 and servos via a computer USB port**, as it cannot supply sufficient current for all motors.
- The **custom ESP32 shield** ensures clean power distribution to all components, preventing voltage drops and unexpected resets during motion.

## BLE Command Protocol

The robotic arm receives commands via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** ‚Äî a low-power wireless communication protocol commonly used in embedded and IoT devices.

Each command is sent as a single character and interpreted by the ESP32 as follows:

| Command | Action                        |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| `'0'`‚Äì`'7'` | Move to one of eight preset positions |
| `'8'`       | Open the claw (to 60¬∞)               |
| `'9'`       | Close the claw (to 120¬∞)             |

Servo transitions are performed smoothly to reduce mechanical stress and improve motion precision.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Arm/` folder in **PlatformIO**, using the **ESP32 DevKitC** environment.
2. Upload `arm_controller.c` to your ESP32 board.
3. Connect the ESP32 to a **5V power source** (e.g., power bank) via the custom shield.
4. On the Raspberry Pi Pico W, start the BLE interface and press the **‚ÄúA‚Äù button** on the touchscreen.
5. Once connected, use the touch interface to send commands (`'0'`‚Äì`'9'`) to the arm.
6. The ESP32 receives the BLE command and moves the servos smoothly to the target position or claw state.

## Final Considerations

This robotic arm structure was inspired by the open-source design shared at [Thingiverse ‚Äì Robotic Arm (MG90S based)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1684471). While the **claw mechanism** was directly adapted from that model ‚Äî with minor adjustments for fit and integration ‚Äî the rest of the structure was fully designed from scratch in Tinkercad to suit the specific goals and constraints of this project.

One of the key structural improvements made in this design was the addition of a **608Zz ball bearing at the base**. This enhancement significantly reduces the mechanical load on the base servo motor, providing:

- **Smoother rotational motion**
- **Greater stability**
- **Reduced wear on the servo gear system**

The result is a more robust and precise base movement, especially useful in setups where the arm must rotate frequently or support added mass.
